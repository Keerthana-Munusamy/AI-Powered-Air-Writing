# ✋ Air Write to Text: Revolutionizing Hands-Free Input with AI 🤖

## 📌 Overview

**Air Write to Text** is an AI-powered system that converts hand gestures into written text in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. Designed for enhanced accessibility, productivity, and comfort, this project offers a futuristic alternative to traditional input devices like keyboards and touchscreens.

With just a webcam and intuitive hand gestures, users can write text without ever touching a device — a solution ideal for hands-free environments like healthcare, manufacturing, education, and accessibility support.
